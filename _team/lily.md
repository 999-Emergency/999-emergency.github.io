Lily-Rose is a person that is struggling to pay her Trans Medical bills and just wants to make the UK Roleplay communities have that extra little bit of realism with correct 1:! scale photon vehicles. I was ashamed at how poorly the UK is displayed in Garry's Mod with the lack of vehicles that I wanted to make a change and make a massive UK ELS Package for all servers to enjoy.
